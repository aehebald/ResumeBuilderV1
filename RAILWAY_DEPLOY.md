# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide (Super Easy!)

Railway is the easiest deployment platform. It automatically detects and deploys Python apps.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Railway Account
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email
3. Free tier gives you $5 credit per month

### Step 2: Deploy Your App
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"** 
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your repository (or create one first)
5. Railway automatically detects it's a Python app and deploys it!

### Step 3: Add Environment Variable
1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Add variable:
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `your-actual-openai-api-key`
4. Click **"Add"**

### Step 4: Done! 🎉
- Railway gives you a URL like `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- Your app is live and ready to use!

## 📋 Alternative: Deploy Without GitHub

If you don't want to use GitHub:

1. **Create Railway Project**: Click "New Project" → "Empty Project"
2. **Upload Code**: Use Railway CLI or connect a Git repo
3. **Add Environment Variable**: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key`
4. **Deploy**: Railway auto-deploys when it detects changes

## 🔑 Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://openai.com/api/
2. Sign up/Login
3. Go to API Keys section  
4. Create new key (starts with `sk-...`)
5. Copy it to Railway Variables

## ✅ What's Included

All files are Railway-ready:
- ✅ `Procfile` - Tells Railway how to start the app
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway configuration  
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- ✅ Updated `app.py` - Works with Railway's PORT
- ✅ All features working

## 💰 Cost

- **Free Tier**: $5 credit/month (plenty for testing)
- **Usage**: Only pay for what you use
- **Sleep Mode**: App sleeps when not used (saves money)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Build Failed?**
- Check that all files uploaded correctly
- Make sure `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

**App Not Starting?**
- Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Variables
- Look at deploy logs for error messages

**Can't Access App?**
- Railway provides a public URL automatically
- Check the "Deployments" tab for the URL
